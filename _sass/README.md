Here is where you can add your Sass "partials". Don't know [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)? No problem! Sass reads CSS, so you can just stick with what you know until you are ready to make the leap.

You can create a file in here called something like `_sass/_home.scss` and `@import` it in your main `css/main.scss`
